# HeroesAndVillains
A small Java swing based game that I made with a partner for SoftwareEngineering201

The Game is simple, you create a team of Heroes that have classes that grant them special abilities. There isn't much to it, you 
start in a town that has places to visit in each cardinal direction. the places are one of four locations: A hospital for healing 
your Heroes with potions (this takes them out of the party for the duration), a Power-up Den (Not my choice of name) where you can 
use upgrades to improve your heroes, a shop in which you can by said upgrades a health potions and a map which reveals the 
directions of the locations, and finally the villain's lair, in which you team fights the villian by playing one or more of the 
three minigames (paper, scissors, rock, a number guessing game, and simple dice game). After the villain is defeated they party 
can move to the next town which has better items for sale and a stronger villain. The final town has boss, which is much stronger 
than his minions, defeating him wins the game.

This was a group project that I took leadership of and did most of the GUI myself, among other things. I unfortunately had this 
assignment at quite a stressful period at uni, and I began to run out of time toward the end, so this isn't my best work sadly.
I really wish I had time to do a better job, but this did prompt me to work fully on some personal projects, of which some are on 
my profile here.
